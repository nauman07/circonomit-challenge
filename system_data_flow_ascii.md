## ðŸ’¡ Summary
This flow represents how Circonomitâ€™s simulation engine processes a business problem from start to finish:

- **Natural Language Input** is parsed into structured blocks & attributes.
- **Overrides** allow what-if scenario modeling.
- **The Engine** computes values with dependency management and caching.
- **Visualization** helps decision-makers interpret the results.

Each step corresponds to a dedicated module and task in your challenge.
